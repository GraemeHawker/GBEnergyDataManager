  Initial National Demand Out-Turn
  Parameters:
    VD: average megawatt value of demand for a Settlement Period INCLUDING transmission losses but EXCLUDING station transformer load, pumped storage demand and interconnector demand
  Example entry:
2017:03:29:00:01:08:GMT: subject=BMRA.SYSTEM.INDO, message={TP=2017:03:29:00:00:00:GMT,SD=2017:03:29:00:00:00:GMT,SP=2,VD=24016.0}

ITSDO
  Initial Transmission System Demand Outturn
  Parameters:
    VD: average megawatt value of demand for a Settlement Period INCLUDING transmission losses, station transformer load, pumped storage demand and interconnector demand. The ITSDO is made available by the System Operator within 15 minutes after a Settlement Period, based on their operational metering. The composition of the Initial Transmission System Demand Out-Turn matches that of the Transmission System Demand Forecast and so ITSDO and TSDF are comparable.

NDF
  National Demand Forecast
  The National Demand Forecast values for every half hour period from the start of the current day to the furthest ahead forecast that has so far been received by the BMRA. Every time an updated forecast is received from the System Operator, BMRA publishes the data in this message and additionally includes previously received forecast values from period 1 of the current day onwards. The Publishing Time field is therefore applicable to each period in the forecast and indicates the time that data for a particular period was last received and the data reported is always that most recently received for each period. The records in the message are ordered by Settlement Date and Period.
  Parameters:
    ZI: Zone Indicator, string, 'B1' through 'B17' or 'N' (also included in message title)
    NR: Number of rows
    VD: Demand Value (MW)
